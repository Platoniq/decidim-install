![[CI] Install Script v.25.1](https://github.com/Platoniq/decidim-install/workflows/%5BCI%5D%20Install%20Script/badge.svg)

A easy guide to install [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim), which is a participatory democracy framework created in Ruby on Rails.

It's a very interesting piece of software but it may be challenging to install it if you are not familiar with the internals.

Here I'll make a step-by-step guide on how to install it on production into a machine with Ubuntu 18.04.

I've made this guide because it can be quite challenging to install Decidim in production (as there's currently not much official documentation covering this). This guide also covers some common problems you may face during the process.

Start here:

1. Installing Decidim on Ubuntu
This will guide you to the process of install Decidim in a clean machine and getting it up an running.<br>
* [Installing Decidim on Ubuntu 18.04](decidim-bionic.md)<br>
* [Installing Decidim on Ubuntu 20.04](decidim-focal.md)<br>
1. [Use an automated script to install Decidim in Ubuntu 18.04](script/README.md)<br>Download a BASH script that performs automatically (almost) all the required steps to install Decidim in Ubuntu 18.04. To use only in freshly installed systems.
1. [Minimal configuration of Decidim](basic-config.md)<br>This part is to configure the 3 extra aspects required run Decidim appropriately. Configure Email sending, SSL security in your server and OAuth authentication.
1. [Installing in Amazon AWS with ElasticBeanstalk](decidim-aws.md)<br>An alternative guide to install Decidim in Amazon AWS. This is a Heroku-like PaaS deployment system. It auto-scales servers if needed and it may be a little cheaper than Heroku.
1. [Decidim update guide](decidim-update.md)<br>Check this to upgrade Decidim to a new version.
1. [Advanced config & tricks](advanced-config.md)<br>A work in progress file to document some common issues and how to solve it (feel free to ask in the issues).
1. [Use Capistrano to automate your deployments](advanced-deploy.md)<br>A guide to professionalize the maintenance of your application. Capistrano allows to safely perform all the tasks related to update your application from your computer.
1. [Ansible playbook for Arch Linux installation](https://github.com/JuliusTZM/decidim_on_arch)<br>The repository contains an Ansible playbook to support Decidim installation with all dependencies on Arch Linux.
